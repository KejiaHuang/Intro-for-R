# Intro-for-R
Assignments of R 

At that time, this was first time for me to learn coding carefully. I had SAS and C class in college, but I didn't have so much experience in coding, only good at eaxm. I still remember the first few assignments are very difficult for me. I spent so much in very easy debugging, such as data type, for loop, r package version, etc. I really spend so much time in exericise and I know I am good at coding...

Write this text to recall the begining for my coding.
